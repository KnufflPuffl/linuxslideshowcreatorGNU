# linuxslideshowcreatorGNU
I created this project, because it's very hard to create a desktop slideshow inside most Linux systems. The only possibility to do this is a available python script, but this is not a very user friendly way (at least not for beginners).  So I decided to start up this little project.  The user should enter a path to a directory with picture files in it, the program reads out the locations, filter out the image files, and create the corresponding .xml file for the slideshow.  May the program could be extended by a GUI and also allow to input the time for each image.  Language: C++ License: GNU v3
